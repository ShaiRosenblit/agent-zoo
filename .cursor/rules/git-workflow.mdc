# Git Workflow Rules

## When to Commit and Push

Commit and push whenever a feature or task is complete:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: descriptive message"
git push
```

## Commit Guidelines

1. **Commit when ready** — After completing a feature, bug fix, or meaningful change
2. **Write clear messages** — Use conventional commit format:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for test additions/changes
3. **Push immediately** — Don't let commits sit locally; push after committing

## Workflow

1. Complete the feature/fix
2. Run tests (if applicable)
3. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Push to remote

## Examples

```bash
# After adding a new feature
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: add user authentication" && git push

# After fixing a bug
git add -A && git commit -m "fix: resolve race condition in agent loop" && git push

# After updating docs
git add -A && git commit -m "docs: improve README with setup instructions" && git push
```
